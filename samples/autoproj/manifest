# List of VCS information or subdirectories of autoproj/ in which to find
# package set definitions.
package_sets:
# Examples from the Rock package set
#   - github: rock-core/package_set

# The layout section specifies what to build. Can include both whole package
# sets or single packages.
#
# layout:
# - rock.core
#

# Whether Autoproj should auto-add packages that declared as optional
# dependencies or not. When auto-adding (false, the default), these
# dependencies will be added to the build unless they are explicitely excluded,
# by listing them in the exclude_packages section. Otherwise, they will be
# ignored unless they are added to the build either by being explicitely listed
# in the layout, or by being added through other dependency chains (metapackages,
# or as dependency of another package)
# ignore_optional_dependencies: false

# Package exclusion: packages can be completely excluded from the build. This is
# an alternative way than using the layout.
#
# Useful if you want to enable a whole package set except a few packages, or if
# you want to exclude some package's optional dependencies.
#
# exclude_packages:
# - gui/.*

# Ignoring packages: assume that some packages are present on disk. Unlike
# exclude_packages, autoproj will not generate an error if a non-excluded
# package depends on an ignored one, but it will not include the package and its
# dependencies in the build.
#
# For instance, if one assumes that the 'rtt' package is already available on
# the machine *and* you're confident that picking it outside of the workspace
# won't create problems, then simply do:
#
# Note that using this obviously hinders repeatability of the build
#
# ignored_packages:
# - rtt
