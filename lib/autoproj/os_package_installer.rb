usually able to install those automatically, but unfortunately your operating
system is not (yet) supported by autoproj's osdeps mechanism, it can only offer
you some limited support.

Some package handlers are cross-platform, and are therefore supported.  However,
you will have to install the kind of OS dependencies (so-called OS packages)

OS dependencies.

  dependencies.

  autoproj reconfigure

about the OS packages that you will need to install manually.
